# Hi, I'm Monica 👋🏾

I'm a software engineer building educational technology at Newsela. I am passionate about making contributing to open-source more approachable, creating technology to elevate people, and building community. I've contributed to GatsbyJS ecosystem and have been a core maintainer of several sites built with GatsbyJS.

<SpeakerNotes>
  I decided to use Gatsby a few years ago to revamp my personal site. As I
  started using Gatsby I got more comfortable with GraphQL and React and had the
  opportunity to tinker with my site which I now consider my personal digital
  playground. I have really enjoyed the developer experience with Gatsby as it
  can be be quite delightful.

<SpeakerNotes>
  If you're curious what my digital playground looks like you can go to
  monica.dev. This is a screenshot of my content index page which features a
  filter feature powered by React Hooks. I wrote about how I built the initial
  search feature functionality on my site at that article.

Using gatsby-image with art direction

Related post: https://www.aboutmonica.com/blog/2020-06-24-exploring-art-direction-in-gatsby

<SpeakerNotes>
  This is waht the header of my site looks like and it features gatsby's image
  techology which is `gatsby-image` and allows the browser to preload only the
  resoruce it needs based on the initial view port size with art direction. I
  also wrote a bit about how I use art direction in Gatsby if you want to learn
  more.{" "}

# What We'll Be Building

A mock conference site built with GatsbyJS that is deployed to Netlify. The site will have multiple pages, including a page with headshots for all speakers, ticket page, individual pages for each talk and more!

# What is Gatsby?

- An open-source, React framework with a solid developer experience for generating static sites
- Gatsby was designed to be performant and accessible
- Plus all the benefits of Jamstack (performant, cheap-to-scale, secure, developer experience, etc.)

<img
  style={{ maxWidth: "80%", textAlign: "center" }}
  src="/gatsby-technologies.png"
/>

<SpeakerNotes>
  Gatsby is a React based static site generator that is performant and designed
  with accessability in mind. A lot of the benefits of Jamstack artchitecture
  you'll get when using Gatsby.
</SpeakerNotes>

## generating? static sites?

<img
  style={{ maxWidth: "80%", textAlign: "center" }}
  src="/gatsby-hydration.png"
/>

<SpeakerNotes>
You may be wondering more about generation and static sites so. Let's walk through what happens in Server-Side Rendered applications like Gatsby where all the pages for the site are statically generated at once in the server.

First, you write the site in React ⚛️ then Gatsby or Next (Static Site Generation) creates a production build of your site using ReactDOMServer, a React server-side API to generate HTML from React. When someone visits your website the first thing they'll see is the HTML generated from the server. JavaScript then loads after the initial page load and the ReactDOM.hydrate() API kicks in to hydrate the HTML page that was rendered from the server with JavaScript. After Hydration the React reconciler APIs take over and the site becomes interactive.

## Toggling JavaScript: SSR vs. CSR

<img

  src="/gatsby-toggle-javascript.gif"
/>
<img
  style={{ maxWidth: "50%", textAlign: "center" }}
  src="/create-react-app-toggle-javascript.gif"
/>

Left: Gatsby site, where when JavaScript is toggled on/off there is very little visible change on the left aside from the image loading as most of the HTML was available without JavaScript. Right: Create React App with visible flash.

<SpeakerNotes>
Let's compare how a Server-Side and Client-Side rendered applications appear when JavaScript is enabled or disabled. For these two examples, I used Gatsby and Create React App for these technologies.

In contrast, in the above image of a Create-React-App which uses client-side rendering and the browser is responsible for constructing the initial HTML. Due to this we just see the bare-bones HTML as opposed to a full HTML document when JavaScript is disabled.

## Gatsby Plugin Library

<img
  style={{ maxWidth: "80%", textAlign: "center" }}
  src="/gatsby-plugins.png"
/>

<SpeakerNotes>
  The Gatsby Plugin Library is a rich ecosytem of open-source plugins designed
  for Gatsby -- with things from extending syntax support for MDX, adding new
  data sources, generate social cards for social media, etc. If there's
  something you're interested in exploring in Gatsby the Gatsby Plugin Library
  is a good place to look for ideas and resources{" "}
</SpeakerNotes>

---

## Gatsby Plugin Examples

- `gatsby-plugin-mdx` to add MDX support. **MDX** allows you to write Markdown that allows you to import JSX React components
- `mdx-embed` (originally was gatsby-mdx-embed) to embed media content such as YouTube videos, Tweets, Codepens, Egghead videos and many more straight into .mdx files.
- `gatsby-source-filesystem` to add local file data to site's GraphQL data layer
- `gatsby-remark-twitter-cards`

  src="/social-media-card.png"
/> <img
  style={{ maxWidth: "50%", textAlign: "center", verticalAlign: "middle" }}
  src="/article-list-mdx.gif"
/>

<SpeakerNotes>
  {" "}
  Some Gatsby plugins I've used are gatsby-plugin-mdx, mdx-embed,
  gatsby-source-filesystem and gatsby-remark-twitter-cards. Talk through
  examples of gatsby-remark-twitter cards and gatsby-plugin-mdx (official mdx
  plugin){" "}

## Gatsby Starters, Themes, Recipes and more

<img
  style={{ maxWidth: "80%", textAlign: "center" }}
  src="/gatsby-starters.png"
/>

<SpeakerNotes>
  Gatsby has a collection of community sourced starters if you want to get an ew
  Gatsby site up and running quickly. The styling and functionality from starter
  to starter vary quite a bit. In addition to starters they also have themes
  which are more composable versions of starters and are experimenting with
  recipes to quickly add new features to a site via CLI. You should check out
  the Gatsby site for more information. We will mostly be working with Gatsby
  plugins today.
</SpeakerNotes>

## Gatsby-Image

One of my favorite Gatsby optimizations is `gatsby-image` which supports different effects like `traced-svg`. Traced SVG is an effect to quickly render SVGs for images as placeholders while the final image loads.

<img
  style={{ maxWidth: "80%", textAlign: "center" }}
  src="/header-traced-svg-example.gif"
/>

Learn more at: https://using-gatsby-image.gatsbyjs.org/

<SpeakerNotes>
  Gatsby also has a library called gatsby-image tht has image loading
  optimizations. One of my favorites is traced svg which puts a placeholder svg
  in the shape of your image until your image loads. Check out the link to see
  the various gatsby-image loading effects
